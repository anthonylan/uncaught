## Getting started

Uncaught comes in two different forms(CSS & Sass)

## Compiled CSS
This version comes with both the minified and unminified CSS files. This option requires little to no setup. Use this if you are unfamiliar with Sass

## Sass
This version contains the source SCSS file. By choosing this version you have more control over the components, and You'll also need a Sass compiler.
